/**
 * Footprint glyph — the visual notation for the path you walked.
 *
 * It lives in `shared` because the map canvas and the **settings preview** must
 * draw the same picture. A second implementation for the preview would drift, and
 * a preview that drifts is not a preview.
 *
 * **Why footprints and not a ring** (owner decision, 2026-07-29). The previous
 * notation was a concentric hairline ring on visited nodes (the old
 * `model/footprint-ring.ts` under `widgets/ontology-map`). Its structural limit
 * was that a ring shares the grammar of the node outline — the selection ring, the
 * expansion aura and the boundary are already circles, so the footprint ring became
 * a fourth circle whose meaning the user had to re-learn each time. Owner:
 * *"Show the visit order on the nodes you walked, and leave small
 * footprints along the connecting lines too."* (show the visit order on the nodes you walked, and leave small
 * footprints along the connecting lines too). A footprint sits **outside the circle
 * grammar**, so that collision cannot arise, and it carries what a ring could not:
 * direction (the toes point the way of travel) and order (the step number beside
 * the node).
 *
 * **The shape is not a setting.** Both-feet shoe prints, fixed. Letting users pick
 * the shape means different people see different pictures, and the screen can no
 * longer state what the mark means. The only thing a user chooses is **how loudly
 * the same meaning is stated** (`FootprintPreference`).
 *
 * **Beside the line, not on it.** Owner: *"Don't overlap the
 * line."* (don't overlap the line). A relation line is the channel carrying a typed fact (containment /
 * dependency); a mark laid on top makes two facts fight over one ink. Footprints
 * are offset along the normal and say only "someone passed along here".
 *
 * Drawn only for pairs that **have** a relation. Two consecutively visited nodes
 * may have none, and tracing prints between them would break the contract that a
 * line means a relation.

 * clamp the print radius to `FOOTPRINT_NODE_RATIO` × the node radius. Large nodes
 * (domains, projects) are already under the cap and do not move at all; only small
