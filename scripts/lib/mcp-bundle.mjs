/**
 * The pure part of the MCP Bundle (`.mcpb`) build.
 *
 * An `.mcpb` is a zip holding one MCP server plus a `manifest.json` that says
 * how to start it — the same idea as `.vsix` or `.crx`. It is the one
 * distribution channel the official MCP Registry accepts that publishes nothing
 * to a package registry: the artifact is a GitHub Release asset, and the
 * registry verifies only its URL and SHA-256. That is why Atlas can be
 * discoverable in the MCP ecosystem while `docs/DECISIONS.md` (2026-07-27) keeps
 * the npm channel retired.
 *
 * Two things here are measured, not assumed:
 *
 * 1. **The bundle carries exactly `mcp/package.json`'s `files` list.** That list
 *    is what the server itself declares as its own shipping surface, so the
 *    bundle cannot drift from it by hand-editing a second list.
 * 2. **One file must lose its types.** `mcp/src/analysis-record.mts` is imported
 *    directly and relies on Node's type stripping, which is unflagged only from
 *    Node 23.6. A host supplies its own Node to a bundle, so the server died on
 *    Node 20 and 22 (`ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION`) until that single file was
 *    compiled to `.mjs`. With it stripped, the same bundle answered `tools/list`
 *    with all 38 tools on Node 20, 22, 24 and 25. The `engines` floor of
 *    `>=24 <25` is this repository's toolchain choice; the SDK's own floor is
 *    `>=20`.
